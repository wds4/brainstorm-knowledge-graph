The Brainstorm Knowledge Graph: Introduction
=====

The Brainstorm Knowledge Graph is a nostr webapp that implements the Decentralized Lists Custom NIP [1] as well as the Custom NIPs that build upon it, including Graphical Organization of Decentralized List Items [2], Properties for Decentralized Lists [3] and Trusted Lists [4]. It will enable the user to view, edit and create Simple Lists, Structured Lists, Object Oriented Lists, Concepts, and Knowledge Graphs. Users are empowered with the option to curate data in their Knowledge Graphs manually or to delegate curation to trusted members of their communities. One of the novel and important features of this app is to facilitate the management of curation and delegation methods. The technical aspects of this app are not difficult, but users are not accustomed to the level of empowerment provided by this app, so it will be important to provide good UX to users who may not yet be familiar with the options available to them.

The skeleton of the app is the open source Nostr-React-Dashboard template from this repository: https://github.com/PrettyGoodFreedomTech/nostr-react-dashboard-template
