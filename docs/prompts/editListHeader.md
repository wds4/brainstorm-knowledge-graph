I would like next to turn our attention to the Edit List Header page at src/views/simpleLists/list/editHeader/editHeaderEvent.js. This page should be similar in structure and appearance to the createList page at src/views/simpleLists/createList/index.js, but should prepopulate all fields with the existing list details from the list header event that is passed to the component. Can you help me to make this page?
